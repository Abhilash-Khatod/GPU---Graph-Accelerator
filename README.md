# üöÄ GPU-Graph-Accelerator

This project implements **PageRank** on graphs of up to **1000 vertices** using three approaches:
1. **Single-threaded CPU** (baseline)  
2. **Multi-threaded CPU** (with efficient thread-level parallelism)  
3. **GPU acceleration with CUDA**  

The implementation achieves significant performance improvements, reducing PageRank computation time from **~1 sec (CPU)** to **~0.02 sec (GPU)** for 10 iterations on a 1000-vertex graph.
